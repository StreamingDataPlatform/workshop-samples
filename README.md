# SDP Code Hub
The official code hub for Dell EMC Streaming Data Platform. This website hosts an essential collection of code
samples, demos, and connectors to kick-start your projects on Pravega streaming storage and Streaming Data Platform
products. The goal of the Code Hub site is to provide customers and users with enough information (between local and
linked content) to get started developing applications that use these two products. The site is extensible, and
supports posting about virtually any relevant public source project or website. Anyone can contribute to the posts,
so long as they meet the guidelines provided below and pass the review process.  

# Posting Process
The following sections describe the necessary process to add a post to the code hub site.

## Fork and PR
To add a post, you will need to fork this repository, and create a branch based on the head of the **gh-pages** branch.  When you are ready to submit your post, create a PR to this repository targeting the **gh-pages** branch.  The only addition that should be made in the PR is a single post file. 

## The Post File
To create a post, add a file under the `_posts` directory (in the appropriate category subdirectory) with the following format:
```
{YEAR}-{MONTH}-{DAY}-{title}.{MARKUP}
```
Where **YEAR** is a four-digit number, **MONTH** and **DAY** are both two-digit numbers, and **MARKUP** is the file extension representing the format used in the file (typically `.md` for Markdown).

## Source Project Requirements
The origin project represented in the posting must meet the following requirements:
* Project source must be public and links to the project and documentation should be included in the post
* The project must be completely implemented, documented, and work on the latest release of Pravega and/or SDP
* In addition to any content posted on the Code Hub, there must be a detailed readme or home page for the project that includes full instructions on how to configure and use it

## Post Requirements
All posts must meet the following requirements to be considered for publishing:
* The identity of the poster must be clear; make sure your github profile is accurate and include your name and role in the author section
* Must have a title and description that clearly explains the purpose and intent of the sample, demo, or connector
* Must be appropriate and relevant, and align to the purpose of the Code Hub site
* Each post must include a clear license statement, usage permissions, and any applicable copyright attributions
    * Posts must also adhere to any license stipulations required by **all** linked source projects 
* The instructions (which may include linked readmes or documentation) should be clear, and anyone should be able to run or use the sample without trouble or confusion

## Review Process
All posts will be reviewed by the SDP App Dev team, where we will do the following:
* Check the above requirements are met, and note any gaps as PR review comments
* Run the actual sample using the provided instructions; any issues encountered will also be added as review comments
* Once approved, the PR will be merged and the post will be immediately published and visible

**Note**: SDP Code Hub maintainers reserve the right to approve or deny posts for any reason.
