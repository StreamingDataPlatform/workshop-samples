# All Jekyll-Bootstrap specific configurations are namespaced into this hash

JB :
    # All links will be namespaced by BASE_PATH if defined.
    # Links in your website should always be prefixed with {{BASE_PATH}}
    # however this value will be dynamically changed depending on your deployment situation.
    #
    # CNAME (http://yourcustomdomain.com)
    #   DO NOT SET BASE_PATH
    #   (urls will be prefixed with "/" and work relatively)
    #
    # GitHub Pages (http://username.github.io)
    #   DO NOT SET BASE_PATH
    #   (urls will be prefixed with "/" and work relatively)
    #
    # GitHub Project Pages (http://username.github.io/project-name)
    #
    #   A GitHub Project site exists in the `gh-pages` branch of one of your repositories.
    #  REQUIRED! Set BASE_PATH to: http://username.github.io/project-name
    #
    # CAUTION:
    #   - When in Localhost, your site will run from root "/" regardless of BASE_PATH
    #   - Only the following values are falsy: ["", null, false]
    #   - When setting BASE_PATH it must be a valid url.
    #     This means always setting the protocol (http|https) or prefixing with "/"
    # BASE_PATH set by baseurl
